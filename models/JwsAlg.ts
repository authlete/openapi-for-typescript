Check your [KB article](https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/jwt-based-access-token).   - as client authorizationSignAlg value, it represents the signature algorithm used when [creating a JARM response](https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/enabling-jarm).   - or as client requestSignAlg value, it specifies which is the expected signature used by [client on a Request Object](https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/request-objects).
